## Prompt Engineering
By now, I'm sure you've heard of what "AI" and ChatGPT are. While most people don't think twice about what question they feed into Large Language Models like ChatGPT, there's actually a whole field of study dedicated to making the perfect input prompt---**[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)**---which focuses on fine-tuning user-input to better shape the response of AI models. 

> üí° In fact, [OpenAI also made a course on prompt engineering](https://medium.com/geekculture/prompt-engineering-course-openai-inferring-transforming-expanding-chatgpt-chatgpt4-e5f63132f422).

Before diving into specific techniques, we'll cover some "quick facts" about prompting:
- Quality of results often depends on **how much information** the prompt provides, and **how well-crafted** it is
- A typical prompt will contain the following elements:
    - **Instruction:** what you want the model to do
    - **Context:** what background knowledge you want the model to have
    - **Input Data:** question that we are interested in the response for
    - **Output Indicator:** the type/format of the output
- In the "instruction", use specific verbs like "write", "classify", "translate", "summarize", etc
- Be very clear and specific on the task you want the model to perform
    - The more detailed your prompt, the better the answer will be
- Instead of saying what "not to do", tell the model what "to do"

For more information on prompting basics, check out [promptingguide.ai](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/basics).

Next, we'll cover some common prompt engineering techniques. For each section, there will be a small challenge. You'll share your responses to each section on a Google Form that the club leader shares with you. You'll also have access to other people's responses, to stalk---I mean learn.

Now, let's go into some specifics!
![](https://cloud-o5nnqusk0-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0giphy.gif)

### Zero-Shot Prompting
> ‚ùì Using zero-shot prompting, come up with a sentence of your own and ask ChatGPT to classify it as spam or safe :)

> ü§î Share your responses and ChatGPT's output on the propmting Google Form that your club leader will share with you

ZSP is essentially giving the model no "training" before asking it a question. This "technique" is what most people use. 

For example, try the following prompt, and come up with your own:
```w!
**User**
Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. 
Text: I think the vacation is okay.
Sentiment:

**ChatGPT**
Neutral
```

While this will work for common problems, it may fail on more unique prompts.

### Few-Shot Prompting
> ‚ùì Using few-shot prompting, ask ChatGPT to output "yes" or "no", based on whether the following words are examples of physical activity. The words are "running" and "diving" However, you cannot tell ChatGPT that it needs to classify for physical activity. Come up with a few examples, like:

```w!
**User**
Swimming | yes
Walking | yes
Sitting | no
Running | 
Diving | 
```

FSP relies on the user providing a couple of examples of expected output to the model, before asking the model to produce its own. If you think about it, giving the model some training examples is very similar to how a human learns. For example:

```w!
**User**
A "whatpu" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses
the word whatpu is:
We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus.
To do a "farduddle" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses
the word farduddle is:

**ChatGPT***
When we won the game, we all started to farduddle in celebration.
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
> ‚ùì Using chain-of-thought prompting, see if you can get ChatGPT to explain the hidden meaning behind a difficult-to-read poem from English class

When using Chain-of-Thought prompting, you'll want to ask the model to **explain the intermediate reasoning steps** before giving the final answer. 

Here's an [example](https://towardsdatascience.com/prompt-engineering-guide-for-data-analysts-54f480ba4d98):
![](https://cloud-6v5c2pm6e-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)

Telling the model to solve it "step by step" helps it **think through its own answer**, giving more accurate results.

Here's [another example](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html) (note that you can also "show" the model what step by step looks like):
![](https://cloud-aaphlohmn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)

### Generated Knowledge Prompting
> ‚ùì Using generated knowledge prompting, get ChatGPT to write a three paragraph essay on why comics and AI belong together. 

> ü§î Remember to keep posting these into the Google Form your club leader sent you!

You can think of [GKP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08387.pdf) as the model **"searching for information itself"**. Here, you ask the model to provide the most relevant facts related to a topic, and then ask the model to generate an answer based on these facts.

These two screenshots are one example of GKP.

[Generating the information](https://towardsdatascience.com/prompt-engineering-guide-for-data-analysts-54f480ba4d98) ("the search"):
![](https://cloud-7rs0kqnrj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)

[Using information to make answer](https://towardsdatascience.com/prompt-engineering-guide-for-data-analysts-54f480ba4d98) ("the answer"):
![](https://cloud-5gt4oyd57-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)

### Self-Refine Prompting
> ‚ùì Using self-refine prompting, ask ChatGPT to generate a function (in your choice of programming language) to play the game [fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#:~:text=Fizz%20buzz%20is%20a%20group,with%20the%20word%20%22fizzbuzz%22.). Though arguably Python is the best language hehe

![](https://cloud-lfhygu0v3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0coding.gif)

You can think of SFP as the model "teaching itself". First, the user asks the model to provide an initial solution. Next, the user asks the model for problems with its original solution. Afterward, the user prompts the model to address the problems in its solution. This process can repeat until the user is happy with the result.

For example:
```w!
**User**
come up with a short positive review for a cactus I bought from amazon

**ChatGPT**
Absolutely thrilled with my Amazon cactus purchase! üåµ It arrived in perfect condition and looks stunning on my desk. Low-maintenance and full of character, it adds a delightful touch of nature to my workspace. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a charming and easy-to-care-for plant companion! üåøüëç

**User**
where is this review lacking?

**ChatGPT**
While the short positive review covers some important points, it could benefit from a few improvements to make it more comprehensive and informative:

Description of the cactus: The review doesn't provide specific details about the cactus's type or any distinctive features. Adding a sentence or two about the cactus's appearance, such as its size, shape, or unique characteristics, would give readers a better idea of what to expect.

Personal experience: While the review mentions being "absolutely thrilled" with the purchase, it doesn't elaborate on the reasons for the excitement. Sharing a brief personal experience with the cactus, such as how it has enhanced the workspace or brought joy, would make the review more relatable and engaging.

Long-term satisfaction: The review doesn't mention how long the cactus has been owned or whether it has maintained its appearance and health over time. Including a comment on the cactus's longevity and continued satisfaction would add value to the review.

Comparison with other cacti or plants: Adding a few words about how this cactus compares to others the reviewer might have owned or seen in terms of ease of care, aesthetics, or uniqueness would make the review more informative for potential buyers.

By incorporating these elements, the review could become more well-rounded and provide potential buyers with a more complete and helpful perspective on the Amazon cactus purchase.

**User**
incorporate this feedback into your original short positive review

**ChatGPT**
Absolutely thrilled with my Amazon cactus purchase! üåµ The Golden Barrel cactus arrived in perfect condition, boasting a delightful round shape and vibrant green color that looks stunning on my desk. Low-maintenance and full of character, it adds a delightful touch of nature to my workspace, brightening up my day with its charm. I've had it for several months now, and it has maintained its health and appearance beautifully, making it a long-term source of joy. Compared to other cacti I've owned, this one stands out for its ease of care and unique aesthetics. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a charming and easy-to-care-for plant companion! üåøüëç
```

### Tree-of-Thought Prompting
> ‚ùì Since tree of thought prompting is a bit more difficult than the others to use, we challenge you to come up with a scenario in which tree prompting could be very useful. Maybe even feed it to ChatGPT. 

TOT is structured just like you think it would! First, the user asks the model to provide possible solutions to a problem. Next, the user asks the model to "run through" each of those solutions, to figure out the best one. 

Here's an example of a [ToT prompt](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/tot):
```w!
Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
then share it with the group.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
The question is...
```

ChatGPT's response:
```w!
Expert 1: The ball is in the living room.

Expert 2: The ball is in the kitchen.

Expert 3: The ball is in the bedroom.

Expert 1: Bob carries the cup to the bedroom, so the ball must be in the cup.

Expert 2: Oh, I see my mistake. Yes, the ball is in the cup.

Expert 3: Agreed, the ball is in the cup in the bedroom.

Expert 1: Next, Bob turns the cup upside down in the bedroom.

Expert 2: After that, Bob walks to the garden and puts the cup down.

Expert 3: Therefore, the ball must have fallen out of the cup when Bob turned it upside down in the bedroom. So, the ball is in the bedroom, not in the cup anymore.

Expert 1: Oh, you're right. I made a mistake. The ball is in the bedroom, not in the cup.

Expert 2: Agreed, the ball is in the bedroom.

Expert 3: Bob then walks to the garage, so the ball remains in the bedroom. It is not in the garden or the garage.

Expert 1: Absolutely, the ball is still in the bedroom.

Expert 2: Yes, the ball hasn't moved from the bedroom.

Expert 3: Therefore, the ball is in the bedroom, not in the garden or the garage.

All three experts agree that the ball is in the bedroom.
```

## DAD JOKE COMPETITION

***GOOD LUCK!***

<details>
    <summary>If you're interested, here's the prompt I used (using Chain of Thought prompting)</summary>

```w!
**User**
generate 5 dad jokes for me. explain why each of them are funny and how you got to each one

**ChatGPT**
Sure, here are five dad jokes for you:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?
Because they make up everything!
Explanation: This joke is a play on words. "Atoms" make up everything in the physical world, but the punchline humorously suggests that they are untrustworthy as they "make up" stories or lies.

Did you hear about the kidnapping at the playground?
He woke up!
Explanation: This joke uses a pun to create humor. The word "kidnapping" is used in a misleading way, making the listener think it refers to a serious event. But, the punchline reveals that it's about a child taking a nap at the playground, using "woke up" in its colloquial sense.

What do you call fake spaghetti?
An impasta!
Explanation: This joke is a classic example of a pun. The word "impasta" sounds similar to "impostor," but it humorously refers to fake spaghetti rather than a person.

Why don't some couples go to the gym?
Because some relationships don't work out!
Explanation: This joke uses a play on words. "Work out" usually refers to going to the gym to exercise, but in the context of relationships, it means that some couples don't succeed or "work out" together.

Why did the scarecrow win an award?
Because he was outstanding in his field!
Explanation: This joke is a clever play on words. The phrase "outstanding in his field" is usually used to describe someone who excels in their profession or area of expertise. In this joke, it takes a literal interpretation, as the scarecrow is literally standing in a field.

Dad jokes often rely on puns, wordplay, and clever twists on common phrases or sayings to create a lighthearted and cheesy sense of humor. They are intentionally simple and cheesy, designed to elicit groans and eye-rolls from the audience, making them a favorite form of humor for many dads and joke enthusiasts alike.

Visual and Artistic Elements: The outline provides a strong narrative foundation, but it would benefit from mentioning specific visual and artistic elements that will enhance the storytelling. Consider describing the art style, character designs, and key visual moments.

Relationship Development: The outline introduces supporting characters, but it could be enhanced by focusing on the development of relationships between Alex, his flight instructor, and fellow students. This can add depth and emotional resonance to the story.

Themes and Lessons: While the outline hints at lessons learned, it could be strengthened by explicitly stating some of the core themes and life lessons that readers will take away from the comic.

Potential Subplots: Think about adding potential subplots that can add depth and complexity to the story. Subplots can involve challenges outside of flying, personal growth, or conflicts that complement the main narrative.

Emotional Impact: Ensure that the emotional impact of the story is emphasized throughout the outline. Consider how the comic will evoke feelings of excitement, tension, joy, and determination in readers.

## Generating the Images
Now, we'll be generating the images that go along with the text in each section! We'll be using [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo) to turn a string of text into an image. Other alternatives include DALL-E and Midjourney, or any other text to image AI model!

**Image Generation Prompting**
In addition to prompt engineering for ChatGPT, you can also carefully craft prompts for image generators to create an image *you would love*. In a prompt for an image generator, it is good to include:
- **Artists to take inspiration from**: Albert Bierstadt, Edward Hopper, Vincent van Gogh, etc
- **Format of the picture**: 3d render, Action Photography, Cartoon, Comic, Pencil Drawing, etc
- **Perspective**: Aerial View, Close Up, Boken, etc
- **Style**: Abstract, Ancient Art, Anime, etc

However, since we've used ChatGPT to generate the comic outline so far, we might as well use it to also generate the images!

Let's start with my first section:
```w!
Meet Alex, a passionate high school student in North Carolina who dreams of earning his private pilot license and is inspired by his aviation enthusiast father. He's determined to make his dream take flight and wants to prove himself both to his father and himself.
```

We'll ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt for Stable Diffusion:
```w!
**User**
Since I'm making the comic. I would like to generate pictures for each section. I'll be using Stable Diffusion to generate these pictures. For the first section: "Meet Alex, a passionate high school student in North Carolina who dreams of earning his private pilot license and is inspired by his aviation enthusiast father. He's determined to make his dream take flight and wants to prove himself both to his father and himself," can you please create a prompt for Stable Diffusion to generate the image?

**ChatGPT**
Prompt for Stable Diffusion:
"Create an image of a passionate high school student named Alex in North Carolina. He is inspired by his aviation enthusiast father and dreams of earning his private pilot license. In the image, Alex is determined and focused, with a determined expression on his face, showcasing his commitment to making his dream of becoming a pilot take flight. The background should feature aviation elements or a subtle representation of his aspirations. The image should capture the essence of his determination and desire to prove himself to his father and himself."

By providing this prompt to Stable Diffusion, the AI model will attempt to generate an image that represents the description you provided, bringing the character of Alex to life in a visual form that aligns with your comic's vision.

**User**
Please make the prompt more relatable to comics

**ChatGPT**
Certainly! Here's a more comic-focused prompt for Stable Diffusion:

Prompt for Stable Diffusion:
"Create a vibrant comic-style illustration featuring Alex, a determined high school student in North Carolina, who dreams of earning his private pilot license. Show Alex with a wide-eyed expression of excitement and wonder as he looks up at the sky filled with airplanes and clouds. Let his aviation enthusiast father be there, wearing a pilot's cap and sharing in his son's enthusiasm, supporting him in his journey. Surround them with motivational aviation posters and aviation-themed d√©cor in the background, symbolizing Alex's aspirations and determination to soar high in the sky. Make sure to capture the essence of Alex's passion for flying and his desire to prove himself, both to his father and to himself, in the details of their expressions and body language."
```

When feeding in a prompt to Stable Diffusion, you'll get four images. If you don't like them, feel free to adjust the prompt or click "Generate image" again. The image I liked the most was:
